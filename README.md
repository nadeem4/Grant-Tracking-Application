# Grant-Tracking-Application

This system was designed to track goverment funds given to various organization for development. Since involved money was part of ethereum Blockchain, so it wasn't easy to fool system, and perform ilicit activities.

For this project, we were team of 3 member, I was writting DAPP  in solidity. and other 2 teammates were gathering functional requirement.

Whenerevr goverment is granting some money organization, then system will create one contract which will contain the information about validity of that fund, where that can be utilized, how much they can use in one go, party involved, all other basic info.

Whenever any penny is used, that will trigger a state change, and all party involved, will be notified about this. 

Every penny utilized can viewed as tree in this system, which makes tracking task easy.

With this system goverment will be informed about expiration of policy, any fraudulent activities. and if policy is about to expire, then goverment can visualize how every penny is spent, then they can decide whether they want to renew it or not.

In case fraudulent acivities, goverment can cancel policy, and take all money back.


In order deploy DAPP we utilized Azure Blockchain Workbench.
